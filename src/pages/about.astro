    <p>Hello! I'm Andrew, an unemployment insurance auditor and former bus operator with over 11 years of professional experience. In my current role, I dedicate myself to helping those who are out of work through no fault of their own, providing clarity and assistance during difficult times.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">My Professional Journey</h2>
    <p>After experiencing the complex world of insurance firsthand due to a car accident, I realized that "full coverage" wasn't what I initially thought it was. This experience opened my eyes to the jargon-heavy language often used by insurance providers. My career in insurance auditing has solidified my commitment to clarity and transparency in all things insurance-related.</p>

  <section class="mission">
    <h2 class="section-title">My Mission</h2>
    <p>I started this blog because I believe that everyone deserves to understand their insurance policies without the confusing lingo. Insurance shouldn't be puzzling, and my goal is to break down the complexities into understandable insights. I strive to make this a place where honesty and transparency are at the forefront.</p>

  <section class="personal">
    <h2 class="section-title">A Little More About Me</h2>
    <p>Outside of my professional life, I'm deeply passionate about photography and enjoy spending quality time with my family. These personal experiences enrich my perspective and translate into the stories and advice I share on this blog.</p>
